<p>It is a motivational story that inspires us to pursue our dreams even if there is no cause.</p>
<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>This is one of the fantastic series that i have ever seen.It portrays the challenges confronted by a brother and his family members to cherish their integrity and sovereighty while trying to be prosperous.</p>
<h3>Crumb</h3>
<p>Just awesome movie.The movie changes our perception towards relatonships.Which means if someone rejects you, you should be willing enough to walk away that's how you regain your power if it meant to be.</p>
